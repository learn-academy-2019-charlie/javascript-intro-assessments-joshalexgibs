# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
    A function is a repeatable task, useful for avoiding repitition in code
    without sacrificing repitition of necessary tasks.
#### 2. What is a method?
    A method is a defined behaviour suited to modifying or retrieving data
    stored in an object.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
    String methods include .charAt(), .substring(), .slice(), and .indexOf(). 
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
    Mutator methods alter data that is stored within the object it is called upon,
    whereas accessor methods avoid doing so despite being able to output altered
    data. In either case, their use is usually to output modified data, with 
    their effects on the original storage of data are capable of mitigation.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
    'console.log()' will output strings or numbers that define data to a terminal
    window and is useful for messages to users or ensuring data is transforming
    correctly. 'return' outputs raw data to be used internally with the rest of
    the code, often used by methods and functions.
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
    I would say pair-programming has helped me the most. It has made me more 
    aware of the importance of clean coding as well as to better communicate my 
    intentions for each piece of code to my peers.
